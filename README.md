This work main attempts to develop a robust segmentation model using a current segmentation methodology, precisely the deep-learning-based method for detecting glaucoma.
At first, a model is built using an dataset fro RIGA. Upon successfully training and building the model, the weights of model for Optic Cup and Optic Disc are saved.
Furthermore, the weights are loaded and re-used to develop a new model using images acquired from a low-cost ophthalmoscope.
